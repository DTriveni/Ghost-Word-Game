# Ghost-Word-Game
This is an interactive two-player Ghost Word Game built in R. Players take turns adding letters to form a word fragment. The game ends when a player either completes a valid word or creates a fragment that can't form any valid word, using a preloaded Scrabble dictionary for word validation.
